// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

// CompareTTS — load each TTS backend (Kokoro, Qwen3-TTS) and synthesize
// a fixed utterance, to sanity-check the vendored MLXAudioTTS path from
// a Mac without a mic.
//
// PRIVATE-SOURCE DEPENDENCY: this tool imports `MLXAudioTTS`, which is
// re-exported by the `Voice` product of the bithuman-sdk-internal `engine/voice/`
// package (the vendored Blaizzy/mlx-audio-swift TTS stack). That stack
// is NOT part of the public binary distribution, so this example cannot
// build against the published SwiftPM package alone — it needs the
// private monorepo `bithuman-product/bithuman-sdk-internal` cloned as a SIBLING
// of this repo:
//
//     ~/code/bithuman-sdk-internal          (private; collaborator access)
//     ~/code/bithuman-sdk-public   (this repo)
//
// The path dep below resolves engine/voice/ via that sibling layout. External
// developers without private access should use the `Voice` API through
// the `bitHumanKit` umbrella binary instead of this dev harness. See
// README.md.
